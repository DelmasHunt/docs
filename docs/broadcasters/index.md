This section of the documentation is for developers who want to leverage the
Catalyst Decentralized Media Server into their video application or workflow. There are many
[use cases](/broadcasters/core-concepts/use-cases) for Livepeer and the
community is excited to see what you build. If you get stuck introduce yourself
in the [#broadcasting](https://discord.gg/8Vr6B2qERb) Discord channel and the
community will be happy to assist.

> Note: These docs are geared towards developers interested in building services
> and applications using the open and permissionless Livepeer Network
> directly. This requires self-hosting the Catalyst Decentralized Media Server and managing your own
> crypto wallet for payments. 
>
> If you prefer traditional payment rails, you can run Catalyst with a
> [Livepeer Video Services](https://livepeer.com) API key. LVS also offers a serverless hosted service 
> with API access to the Livepeer Network.
