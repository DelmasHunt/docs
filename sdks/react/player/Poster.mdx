<Info>
  When used with Livepeer's playback info API, `getSrc` will automatically parse
  any available thumbnail images in the JSON response and pass them to `Poster`.
  The example above assumes that the playback info has a "Thumbnail (JPEG)"
  source.
</Info>

#### Features

- Displays a preview image as a placeholder before media playback starts
- Conditionally renders based on the availability of a thumbnail image

### Anatomy

Import the components and piece the parts together.

```tsx
import * as Player from "@livepeer/react/player";

function MediaPlayerComponent() {
  return (
    <Player.Root>
      <Player.PlayingIndicator>
        <Player.Poster />
      </Player.PlayingIndicator>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

## Usage

### Props

`Poster` accepts all typical HTML `img` props.

#### `forceMount`

Ensures consistent presence in the DOM, aiding in the smooth application of
animations.

#### `src`

Specifies the URL for the poster image, allowing for a customized preview. If
not set, the component attempts to retrieve a poster from the media's context.

### Data Attributes

#### `data-livepeer-poster`

Identifies the poster component within the Player.

#### `data-visible`

Signifies if the poster is visible (`"true"`) or hidden (`"false"`), useful for
CSS-based animations.
