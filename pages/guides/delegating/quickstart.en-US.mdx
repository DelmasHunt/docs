#### Step 3: Enable CORS [Optional]

If you are developing a frontend application and want to get started quickly
with the API, you can create an API key with CORS access enabled. API keys
created with this option can be used from the browser from any origin for which
it is configured.

#### Step 4: Click `Create`.

#### Usage

To use an API key, you can simply add an `Authorization` header to your request
with the`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value.

**For example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```

With this, you're ready to start building!
