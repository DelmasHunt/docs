# Retrieve Playback Info

You can retrieve the playback information by calling the `GET` playback endpoint with the `playbackId`.

<Callout type="warning">
  By providing an IPFS CID or an Arweave transaction ID, you can retrieve the
  playback information of the relevant asset. However, if the request is not
  authenticated, the response will only provide the first available source
  associated with that ID. To access the sources of your own assets, you must
  authenticate the request by including the Authorization header with the Bearer
  token.
</Callout>

### Request

```bash
curl 'https://livepeer.studio/api/playback/{id}'
```

### Response

200 OK
