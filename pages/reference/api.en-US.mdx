# API Reference

Welcome to the Livepeer API reference docs. This reference doc highlight all the endpoints which are exposed on the standard Livepeer API and explain how to use them and what they return.

The Livepeer API is organized around REST, has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
