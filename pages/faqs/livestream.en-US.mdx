# Livestream FAQ


## Is there a token gating feature for livestreams?

Yes, there are two important factors to consider, `create signing keys` and also specify the `playbackPolicy` type.

> The playbackPolicy parameter can be added to a stream when it is being created or to an existing stream.
> 

Here is the [Playbackpolicy Guide](../guides/developing/access-control) that has information on how to set this up.


## How can I set the bit rate of a livestream?

You can set the bitrate of a stream when creating a new stream. Here is the documentation on how to set them:

- Using the [API Reference](../reference/api/create-stream)
- Using the [SDK Reference](../reference/livepeer-js/stream/useCreateStream#profiles)

## Can I stop in the middle of a livestream?

Yes, you can use the `suspend` parameter in the `stream`
API endpoint along with the stream Id. More information on this process is found in the [API Reference](../reference/api/update-stream#suspend-stream).


## Is there a way to play a livestream with only the audio?

If you want to provide only the audio of the stream, you can use `?video=none`at the end of a `.m3u8` URL to get an audio-only stream.

For example:`https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8?video=none`.

## Why does my latency seem to be high when livestreaming?

If you are having latency issues, try checking your network speed using [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net), also check your settings for your broadcaster, as they can be some primary factors.

For more information on the configurations see our [support matrix](../reference/api-support-matrix#livestream).

## How do I start streaming with Livepeer Studio?

Here are guides on how to [create a stream and watch](../guides/developing/create-a-livestream)
and [stream using OBS](../guides/developing/stream-via-obs).

## How do I set up a custom RTMP domain?

Go to your hosting service and configure your CNAME to use `rtmp.livepeer.com` 

## Can I stream directly from the browser with Livepeer?

We do not have WebRTC technology for livestreaming. but we do have `WebRTMP SDK` demo in our [Example Apps](../reference/example-applications).
