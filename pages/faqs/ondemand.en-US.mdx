# On Demand FAQ


## Can a video with the same name be uploaded multiple times?

Yes, if a video that has the same name is uploaded, it will be treated as a new asset created with its own asset Id, playback Id, and other properties.

## Is there a way to see how many views a video has?

Yes, there is the ability to see how many views an uploaded video has.

Here is the [Viewer Engagement Guide](../guides/developing/viewer-engagement) with more information and implementation.

## Is there a way to generate thumbnails for assets?

We have a ***prototype*** out for thumbnail generation, and recently deployed an example application to showcase the [Thumbnail Generation API](https://thumbnails.withlivepeer.com/)

***This is still a prototype, so we don't recommend adding it to production.***

## What is the size limit for an asset to be uploaded?

Currently, only file sizes up to 10GB are supported.

Visit the [Support Matrix](../reference/api-support-matrix#on-demand) to see more information on uploading assets.

## What are the formats that is supported for uploading with On Demand?

## How do I store assets to IPFS with Livepeer Studio?

It is easy to store an asset to IPFS after it is already uploaded to Livepeer Studio. 

Dashboard method:

- Click the `+ Upload` asset button under the Asset tab in the dashboard.
- Then add the asset by dragging and dropping it into the box or select the files from your local machine
- Once your asset is uploaded, click the`Upload to IPFS` button and in a few minutes, you should see a `CID` return.

To learn more about using the API or SDK method, see our docs for [Update Assets](../reference/api/update-asset#updating-storage) and [useUpdateAsset](../reference/livepeer-js/asset/useUpdateAsset).

## Does an asset get transcoded when it is uploaded using the On Demand feature?

Yes, when the asset gets uploaded, it is then passed to the Livepeer network to get transcoded. Please visit our [10-minute primer](https://livepeer.org/primer) to learn more on this process.
