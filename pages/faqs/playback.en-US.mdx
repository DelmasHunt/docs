# Playback FAQ


## Why is the playback URL not working when I use it in the browser?

In order to view a livestream or an asset, you would have to use a video player is required. Livepeer has a guide that provided information on using:

- [LivepeerJS Player](../guides/developing/player#using-the-livepeerjs-player)
- [Your own player](../guides/developing/player#using-your-own-player)
- [Embeddable player](../guides/developing/player#embeddable-player)

You can also test the playback URL with the following websites:

- [https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test?format=hls&manifest=](https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test?format=hls&manifest=)
- [https://hls-js.netlify.app/demo/](https://hls-js.netlify.app/demo/)
- [https://hlsanalyzer.com/](https://hlsanalyzer.com/)

> *Safari does support m3u8, so it will work if you paste the playback URL in a Safari browser.

## The playback fails with ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT?

This can be due to ISP restrictions in your region.

- Try using a VPN to see if you are able to view the video.
  - If this is working then, it is realted to your ISP provider and notify us.
  - If this is still not working, try to view from another country with the VPN. If this is wither working or not, notify us.
